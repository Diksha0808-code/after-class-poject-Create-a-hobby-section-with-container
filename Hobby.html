      <h1>I like to play piano</h1>
      <p>
        Piano is a musical instrument.There are two main types of piano: the
        grand piano and the upright piano. The grand piano offers better sound
        and more precise key control.

      <p>
        The upright piano is more commonly used due to its smaller size and
        lower cost.
